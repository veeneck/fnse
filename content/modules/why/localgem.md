North Shore Elementary has been proudly serving students for over 90 years and is the alma mater to many of today’s leaders in St. Petersburg.  It is a small school with character, compassion, diversity, and ingenuity that continues to define what successful public education should and can look like.  With approximately 350 students, the small size of North Shore allows for all teachers and staff to know all students, not just the ones in their classes.  Whether you are walking around the campus, participating in school-wide events, or at the monthly assemblies you can see and hear teachers, students, and parents supporting each other and engaging in each other’s lives.  Additionally, the teachers who come to North Shore Elementary to teach stay there, and are continually supported to grow and develop their craft as they see fit.
