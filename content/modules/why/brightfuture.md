There has already been noticable progress with the implementation of programs like [7th Hour](/nse#7<sup>th</sup>Hour) and opportunities for [exceptional students](/nse#ExceptionalStudents). Not to mention, a [ton of cool things](/nse#Highlights) are happening around campus. Then, add in [physical upgrades to the campus](#), [boosting classrooms](#), and [continued learning for teachers](#) and it becomes easy to see how much potential North Shore Elementary has in the coming years.
