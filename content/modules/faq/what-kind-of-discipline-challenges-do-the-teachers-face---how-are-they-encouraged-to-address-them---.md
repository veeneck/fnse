The instances in which students are referred for excessive behavior or discipline problems in virtually nonexistent at North Shore Elementary.  Our school expectations are embedded in our **_Guidelines for Success_** that form the acronym KNIGHTS (**K**eep Trying**, N**urture our environment, **I**nspire cooperation, **G**ive our best effort, **H**ave respect, **T**ake responsibility, **S**upport fellow Knights).  Our **_Guidelines for Success_** help teachers align their classroom rules with the school‐wide Positive Behavior System (PBS) and expectations. The **_Guidelines for Succes_**s are reviewed daily on our morning news show, the Knightly News, and are posted throughout all common areas in the school.  
   
 Our school utilizes a school‐wide Positive Behavior System (PBS) classroom management plan consistent with our core values, Guiding Principles, and CHAMPs. CHAMPs is a proactive and positive approach to classroom management. CHAMPs translates the research on effective classroom and behavior management into easy-to-implement, practical strategies for classroom teachers. Teachers incorporate restorative practices in the classroom through weekly circle meetings, as well as other informal classroom circles. Additionally, restorative practices are exercised when addressing student discipline issues.
