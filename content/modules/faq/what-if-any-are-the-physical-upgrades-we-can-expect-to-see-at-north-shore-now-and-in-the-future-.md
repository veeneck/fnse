North Shore Elementary opened in 1927 as Coffee Pot Elementary and has all of the original buildings plus a few new ones and a few portables.  In recent years, attention has come for the need to 1) Update areas of North Shore’s campus, 2) To allow our school pride to show with better views from 1st Street and 34th Avenue, and 3) To plan for growth.  North Shore Elementary completed the first phase of a campus renovation in the summer of 2017 in which the school entrance (on 35th Avenue NE), front office, main hallway and the fireplace room were renovated.  Addressing the external perception issue along 1st and 34th, we are very excited that the current chain link fence will be replaced with black aluminum fencing tied together with brick columns accenting the original architecture of the school. Additionally, we are working to make the sign on 1st into more of a monument sign, and increase the landscaping along the parking lot to soften and improve curb appeal.  Finally, a smart growth master plan is currently being developed.   In collaboration with parents, administration, the district and a local architect firm, this growth plan will include: a new 6 or 8 classroom building, the addition of VPK to North Shore, and potentially completely transform the 1st Street side of the campus.
