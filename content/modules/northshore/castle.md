C.A.P. is the acronym for the Castle Apprenticeship Program, previously called the “Schoolwide Enrichment Model” (SEM) that North Shore Elementary piloted in 2016. CAP is a [research-based program out of the University of Connecticut](https://gifted.uconn.edu/semr-about2/) that focuses on giving every child exposure to gifted curriculum and project based learning. This is an opportunity for all students to explore an area of interest in a nontraditional setting. CAP is traditionally experienced as an 8-week session.  Every Wednesday from 8:45AM – 9:45AM students report to a “cluster” that they have chosen based on their personal interests. Throughout this 8-week session, each cluster works on creating a final product that they will showcase for parents and families at the end of the session. Previous projects include:
