title = "How does the Gifted Program work at North Shore? "

+++
Currently North Shore Elementary has 53 students enrolled in its gifted program and houses a full-time gifted Teacher.  Students in the gifted program meet daily with the other students in their grade level and the gifted teacher and engage with an innovative project-based learning gifted curriculum.  

Unlike many other schools North Shore screens all incoming Kindergarteners for the gifted program, and then has identified students tested by the district.  By doing this the school eliminates teacher and parent bias when testing for the gifted program and is better able to serve all students.
